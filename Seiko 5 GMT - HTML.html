          <i>Seiko 5 GMT Series</i>
      
          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>The Seiko 5 GMT collection is an exciting addition to Seiko's well-known 5 series, 
          offering a practical yet stylish watch for those who need more than just the time.</p> 
          <p>Designed with the modern traveler in mind, these watches feature a GMT function, 
          allowing you to track a second time zone with ease—ideal for frequent flyers or 
          anyone who needs to stay connected across different parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Known for its design and affordability, the Seiko 5 line has been a great pick for entry-level watch enthusiasts, 
          and the GMT models build on that legacy with enhanced functionality. 
          The collection offers a range of designs but still quite simple, but that is how Seiko runs.</p>
          <p>Whether you specifically need to view multiple timezones or are simply looking for a beater watch, 
          then the Seiko 5 GMT line provides a perfect balance of performance, value, and style.</p>              
      
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>We have had multiple homages or even direct copies of more eye-catching watches and Seiko is'nt a stranger to this, 
            however they have had a refreshing new design for the new GMT line.
          Notably the Batman Blueberry colorway can be seen asa homage to the Rolex GMT Master II.</p>
          <p>Instead of the matt/glossy ceramic bezel most watches would have, Seiko has instead opted for a glass feel with a high polishing.</p>

            <p>This is the first SKX GMT series watch to feature a black-coated stainless steel case and bracelet.</p> 
            <p>The bezel's navy and purple tones are inspired by Tokyo's downtown sunsets, where Horigome honed his skateboarding skills. 
            The back of the watch displays Horigome's signature <i>(Please see image on top-right)</i>
            , along with “LIMITED EDITION” and a unique serial number, marking its exclusivity.</p>

          <h3>Dials (Check pictures on right)</h3>
          <p>The dials range from a multitude of colors which I really enjoy, usually there is'nt enough choice but 
            Seiko has outdone themselves with the design and I'm happy with the current selection.</p>

          <h3>Final Verdict</h3>
          <p>My final verdict of the watch after owning it for multiple years is that for the  price this watch blows everything out of the water.</p>
          <p>I'm overall very pleased with the Pagani Design PD-1662. For the price, it offers impressive quality and a solid range of features, 
            making it a great value.</p>

          <p>It's both attractive and practical, fully meeting my need for a GMT watch. While it's certainly not a Rolex—
            and doesn't pretend to be—it's a worthwhile alternative for those who want a GMT watch without a sky-high price tag. </p>
          <p>I'd recommend this watch to anyone who appreciates the design and functionality of 
            the Rolex GMT Master II but is open to a more affordable option with a few compromises, 
            such as potential movement quirks and a more mainstream look.</p>
